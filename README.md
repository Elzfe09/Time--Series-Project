# Time--Series-Feature Engineering for Predictive Analysis ( CNTARIMA)

this repository contain two different initiatives under time series model. 

## 1st Task 
focusing on transforming data to uncover underlying patterns and improve the predictive model performance using **feature engineering** on bike sharing dataset 

---
### About Dataset
bike sharing dataset contains date, normalize temperature, humidity, windspeed, and other external factors such categorized week name, working day, and holiday that might contributed to total rental based on that aspects 
---
## Feature Engineering Task:
before that always set date to index for time series purposes
